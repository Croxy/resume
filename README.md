# Resume Project

Welcome to my resume project! I hope you like it! 

The current iteration is a working prototype (front-end only) for a web application I plan on building to help create/edit resumes online. 

This idea came about when I wanted to update my resume. Editing my resume in traditional word processors was too laborious so I decided to create an easily editable JSON format.

After a little research I found https://jsonresume.org/ and it gave me a good starting point. I modified the JSON Resume specification to fit my specific needs. 

I make use of the [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/) (a template engine) and a custom CSS style sheet for most of the heavy lifting.
