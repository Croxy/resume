# Resume Project

Welcome to my resume project! I hope you like it! 

The current iteration is a working prototype for a web application I plan on building to help create/edit resumes online. 

This idea came about when I wanted to update my resume but but specify it in JSON.

 After a little research I found https://jsonresume.org/ and it gave me a good starting point. I modified the JSON Resume specification to fit my specific needs. Future iterations will likely adhere to specification more strictly.

I make use of the Handlebars.js (templating engine) and moment.js (date/time tools for JavaScript) libraries in the project currently.

Future plans for this project are to move to a more full-featured front-end frame work (likely Vue.JS) for handling the templating and developing a back-end component where a user could elect to save the resume (and revision history).
